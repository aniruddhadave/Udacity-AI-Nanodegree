    "Tuning RNNs for a typical character dataset like the one we will use here is a computationally intensive endeavour and thus timely on a typical CPU.  Using a reasonably sized cloud-based GPU can speed up training by a factor of 10.  Also because of the long training time it is highly recommended that you carefully write the output of each step of your process to file.  This is so that all of your results are saved even if you close the web browser you're working out of, as the processes will continue processing in the background but variables/output in the notebook system will not update when you open it again.\n",
